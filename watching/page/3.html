                    <p>
                        This webpage is the culmination of my research into the Cult of the Endless Void. I hope that is it of use to you. Sorry for hiding it, but the Cult would have found a way to take it down if they found out. 
                        <br><br>
                        I didn’t think it would come to this. I thought I could stop them—that I could outpace the cult and find a way to unravel their plans before it was too late. But the deeper I went, the more I realized I was already caught in their grip. By the time I understood the truth, they had me.
                        They plan to make me their Vessel. The bridge between our world and the Void they serve.
                        <br><br>
                        By the time you read this, they will have captured me.
                        I need you to understand: I’m not asking for rescue. I’ve accepted what will happen to me. But there’s still time to stop the darkness from spreading further.
                        <br><br>
                        There are two paths.
                        When the moment comes, trust yourself to do what’s right. And know that, in the end, I’ll be at peace, no matter the cost.
                    </p>

                <h1>& The End:</h1>
                <h2>Free or Destroy the Vessel</h2>
                <h3>"The Vessel holds the key to the Void’s invasion. Break the bond, and the Void’s power collapses."</h3>
                <p>
                    The cult chose me to act as the Vessel because of a unique, untapped connection to the Void—whether through fate, genetics, or a dark lineage passed down through generations. As the Vessel, <strong>my mind and soul have become the bridge</strong> through which the Void enters our world. If I can be freed from this connection, the ritual will be broken, but if no other option remains, <strong>destroying</strong> the Vessel may be the only way to stop the Void.
                    <br>
                    Two Paths to Severing the Connection:
                    <br><ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Free the Vessel:</strong>
                            <br>
                            To free me from the Void’s influence, you must find a way to <strong>break the psychic and spiritual bond</strong> that the cult has created. The cult’s magic is powerful, and I am likely lost in the darkness, unable to differentiate between my own thoughts and <strong>the Void’s whispers</strong>.
                                <br><br>
                            Freeing me will involve destroying  the artifact the cult is using as the <strong>focal point</strong> for the ritual. It’s more than just an object—it’s the anchor that ties me to the Void, the symbol of their control over me. As long as it exists, the Void can maintain its grip on my mind, pulling me deeper into its abyss.. <strong>Shatter that artifact</strong>, and you’ll <strong>sever the bond</strong>. Without it, the cult’s ritual will begin to unravel, and their hold on me—and the world—will weaken. However, <strong>the process will be dangerous</strong>—both for me and for anyone attempting to help. Expect the Void to fight back, sending visions of terror or shadows to block your path.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Destroy the Vessel:</strong>
                            <br>
                            If freeing me becomes impossible or the ritual has progressed too far, the only remaining option is to <strong>destroy the Vessel</strong>. As brutal as it sounds, this may be the only way to sever the connection between the Void and the physical world. The cult will have bound me so tightly to the Void that my body has become the focal point for the ritual, after the artifact is drained of its power. <strong>Ending my life</strong> will sever the tether between realms, disrupting the flow of the Void’s essence and stopping the ritual in its tracks.
                                <br><br>
                            Destroying the Vessel must be done at a critical moment in the ritual, typically during <strong>the Eclipse</strong> when the Void’s power is at its peak. Hesitation could be fatal, as the cult will protect the Vessel at all costs, and the Void will try to <strong>influence you into sparing me</strong>. But once the Vessel is destroyed, the ritual will collapse, and the world will be saved from <strong>eternal darkness</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                        “To be part of the Void is to be free from fear, free from time, free from suffering. The light will betray you. Only the darkness remains."
