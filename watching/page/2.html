                    <p>
                        This webpage is the culmination of my research into the Cult of the Endless Void. I hope that is it of use to you. Sorry for hiding it, but the Cult would have found a way to take it down if they found out. 
                        <br><br>
                        I didn’t think it would come to this. I thought I could stop them—that I could outpace the cult and find a way to unravel their plans before it was too late. But the deeper I went, the more I realized I was already caught in their grip. By the time I understood the truth, they had me.
                        They plan to make me their Vessel. The bridge between our world and the Void they serve.
                        <br><br>
                        By the time you read this, they will have captured me.
                        I need you to understand: I’m not asking for rescue. I’ve accepted what will happen to me. But there’s still time to stop the darkness from spreading further.
                        <br><br>
                        There are two paths.
                        When the moment comes, trust yourself to do what’s right. And know that, in the end, I’ll be at peace, no matter the cost.
                    </p>

                <h1>& Their Ritual:</h1>
                <h2>The Ritual of Eternal Darkness</h2>
                <h3>"The end of light. The end of time. The end of us all."</h3>
                <p>
                    The ritual is designed to <strong>merge our reality with the Endless Void</strong>, an ancient, primordial force that predates the universe itself. Once the ritual is complete, the physical world will be swallowed by the Void’s infinite darkness. There will be no stars, no sun—no life. Everything we know will dissolve into the <strong>eternal abyss</strong>, where existence itself is erased.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Ritual Phases:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The Awakening:</strong>
                            <br>
                            The cult has been preparing for years, gathering fragments of <strong>dark energy</strong>, which is a physical manifestation of the Void’s essence. The ritual began the moment this matter was released into our world, causing strange disturbances, unnatural shadows, and unexplained phenomena—signs of the Void taking hold.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The Vessel:</strong>
                            <br>
                            I was chosen to act as <strong>the vessel</strong>—a living anchor that will open the final gateway between our world and the Void. By using a living being, the cult can give the Void a direct pathway into our reality. Once the bond is fully formed, the vessel will cease to exist, consumed by the darkness, and the Void will spill over, covering everything.                        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The Eclipse:</strong>
                            <br>
                            In the final phase of the ritual, the sky itself will go black as all light is extinguished. The cult believes that this “Eclipse” marks the merging of realms, where the boundaries between the physical and the Void collapse. In this eternal night, <strong>all living things will lose their sense of self, merging with the Void’s infinite darkness, where time, space, and life will be meaningless</strong>.                        
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                        “The Void does not discriminate. It devours everything—life, light, even the mind. Once <strong>the vessel</strong> is fully integrated, there will be no stopping it."
                        </p>
