                    <p>
                        This webpage is the culmination of my research into the Cult of the Endless Void. I hope that is it of use to you. Sorry for hiding it, but the Cult would have found a way to take it down if they found out. 
                        <br><br>
                        I didn’t think it would come to this. I thought I could stop them—that I could outpace the cult and find a way to unravel their plans before it was too late. But the deeper I went, the more I realized I was already caught in their grip. By the time I understood the truth, they had me.
                        They plan to make me their Vessel. The bridge between our world and the Void they serve.
                        <br><br>
                        By the time you read this, they will have captured me.
                        I need you to understand: I’m not asking for rescue. I’ve accepted what will happen to me. But there’s still time to stop the darkness from spreading further.
                        <br><br>
                        There are two paths.
                        When the moment comes, trust yourself to do what’s right. And know that, in the end, I’ll be at peace, no matter the cost.
                    </p>

                <h1>& Their Beliefs:</h1>
                <h2>The Endless Void Cult - An Overview</h2>
                <h3>"They see darkness as the answer. To everything."</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cult Name:</strong> The Cult of the Endless Void
                    <ol>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The cult seeks to summon an eternal darkness by merging all reality with The Endless Void, a cosmic entity that represents the end of all things. This darkness will consume consciousness, erasing individual identities and returning all beings to the "primordial state"—a void of nothingness where time and existence cease.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The Endless Void is <strong>not a god</strong>, but a primordial force—a cosmic black hole, ever-hungry and unyielding. In its presence, there is <strong>no hope, no light, no life</strong>. Only an eternal, consuming emptiness.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>They believe that by merging with the Void, they will <strong>become eternal</strong>, free from the constraints of the physical world. No pain. No fear. No identity. Just pure, absolute existence as part of the dark nothingness.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Key Belief:</strong> The cult believes that the end of all things is inevitable, and that by surrendering themselves to it, they can <strong>escape the torment of individual consciousness</strong> and <strong>find peace in non-existence</strong> They see the endless darkness as a return to the “primordial state,” a sort of universal rebirth.
                    <br>The cult views reality as a temporary, fragile illusion—one that blinds people to the truth of the Void. They believe that human suffering, fear, and pain are products of existence itself, and only by <strong>embracing the Void</strong> can one transcend these limitations. To them, life is a cruel cycle of birth, decay, and death, but within the Void, there is <strong>no beginning or end—only infinite, peaceful nothingness</strong>. Their rituals are seen as a means to "liberate" the world from this cycle, spreading the Void’s influence until all life is consumed and returned to the <strong>primordial darkness</strong>.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <p>
                        “To be part of the Void is to be free from fear, free from time, free from suffering. The light will betray you. Only the darkness remains."
