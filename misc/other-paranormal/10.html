                so, last night i was walking home from a friend’s house. it was around midnight, and the street was completely empty—just me, the flickering streetlights, and the sound of my own footsteps. it felt kind of eerie, but i brushed it off.
                    <br><br>
                as i got closer to my street, i saw a figure standing under one of the streetlights a little further down. at first, i thought it was just some guy standing there, maybe waiting for a ride or something. but the weird part? they weren’t moving at all—just standing totally still.
                    <br><br>
                i kept walking, glancing over every few seconds, and something about them just didn’t feel right. i couldn't make out their face, and the way the light hit them, it was like they were almost... blurry? i stopped for a second to get a better look, and just as i did, the streetlight flickered again and the figure was gone.
                    <br><br>
                no one was around, no footsteps, nothing. i looked around for a bit, but there was no sign of anyone, just an empty street. i don’t know if it was a person or something else, but whatever it was—it didn’t feel normal.
                    <br><br>
                has anyone else had something like this happen??
