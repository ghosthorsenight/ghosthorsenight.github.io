                    last night was like any other—i was binge-watching my favorite show and munching on snacks when something caught my eye. it was about midnight, and the only light in the room was from the tv. suddenly, i noticed a shadow moving across the wall behind me. i turned around, thinking it was just my cat, but she was curled up on the couch, sound asleep.
                    <br><br>
                    i squinted into the darkness, and that’s when i saw it—a tall figure standing in the corner of the room. it looked like a person, but it was all black, like a shadow that didn’t quite belong. my heart started racing, and i couldn’t move for a second. i rubbed my eyes, thinking i was just seeing things, but when i opened them, it was still there.
                    <br><br>
                    the figure didn’t move, just stood there, watching me. i grabbed my phone to turn on the flashlight, but before i could even press the button, it disappeared. i sat there in silence, my heart pounding, trying to process what just happened. was it just my imagination, or did i really see something? i couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever it was had been staring right at me.
                    <br><br>
                    now, i’m honestly too freaked out to sleep. has anyone else had a strange experience like this? i could really use some reassurance right now.
                    <br><hr>
